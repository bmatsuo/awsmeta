# awsmeta

awsmeta provides a convenience wrapper around a subset of the functionality provided by the [EC2 instance metadata API](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html). It, effectively, allows you to discover the settings used to create an instance from within an instance. This can be used as a component in auto-provisioning scripts.
